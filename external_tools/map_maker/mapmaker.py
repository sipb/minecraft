#This Python script was created by tjmurphy@mit.edu in order to convert a 128x128 image
#into a list of blocks to place in a Minecraft world to show up on a map, to create
#things like wall posters. Provide it as input the image you want, and a file which
#outlines the available colors for use in a Minecraft map. I pulled this file from
#the Minecraft wiki, where a table with colors can be found for reference.

#There are three possible outputs:
#1. Render an image of what your map will look like after converting to blocks, showing and saving it
#2. Output a list of blocks to build by hand
#3. Output a Minecraft Schematic file of your image for easy pasting
