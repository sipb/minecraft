# We can't do an AFS backup unless
#  a) we're under the lock
#  b) we have tokens
#
# unfortunately, we can't guarantee both of these at the same time,
# but we can guarantee a valid token once we get one, using k5start.
# As a result, we're going to use a clever scheme, in which we
# premptively lock, run k5start, and if that succeeds, we can then do
# the backup.  If not, we release the lock and try again.
#
# For this to work, we need to run k5start in "kinit daemon" mode,
# which means we need a pid fie.
